I have created comment_hierarchy.rb and column of delete_at in comment_hierarchy table.

However, all record in comment_hierarchy table got REALLY deleted forever.

This might be good enough since we do not restore all nested_comments anyway for the users. We soft-delete all comments ONLY for the government's cyber security law.
